    <h1>Hello, internet!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b> from a <i>terrific</i> class I'm taking at <a href="www.launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?</p>
    <p class="">There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML and CSS. When I'm done, these last two paragraphs will take on a lighter colour than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.</p>
    <p class="" id="">This is the final paragraph. It also uses the 'class' attribute as well as an 'id' attribute. We'll use some CSS and the 'id' attribute to underline the entire paragraph.</p>
